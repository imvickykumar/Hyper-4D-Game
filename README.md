# `Hyper 4D Games`

-------------------

**After creating** [*`3D Games`*](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Ursina-Engine-Panda3D-Games#-games--screenshots--videos) like **`Minecraft`** *in* `Ursina Engine`, 

    No matter if I can create a 4D Game or not, but I can start trying it.

    These kind of Videos give me Hope of Innovating new Technologies.

     You know what, if you create a closed cube around you in minecraft,
     then No one can enter in without breaking it from outside in 3D games.
     
     But in 4D games, there are many uncovered surfaces and say for example,
     an HYPERSPIDER can appear from Nowhere in your 3D shelter in 4D games.

    I thought 4th dimention is time like (x,y,z,t) 
    but it's actually (x,y,z,w)

    where,
        t is time, and, ...

        w is projection of 4D object on 3D space, 
        just like shadow of 3D object on 2D plane.

    It might be, t is 5th Dimention like, (x,y,z,w,t)
    and, w can be changed by scrolling curser as shown in Ref. Video, 
    where a HyperSpider appeared in closed cube from Nowhere.

     2D and 3D Fancy words are Outdated,
     Let's talk about 4D Hypercube and one Dimentional Games.

`Projection` of **2D View** on *1D line*.
