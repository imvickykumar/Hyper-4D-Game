## *Run [`HyperSphere.py`](https://github.com/imvickykumar999/Hyper-4D-Game/blob/main/4D%20Games/HyperSphere.py) then `Press and Hold x` to move in 4th Dimention*

---------------------------------

    I thought 4th dimention is time like (x,y,z,t) 
    but it's actually (x,y,z,w)
    
    where,
        t is time, and, ...
        
        w is projection of 4D object on 3D space, 
        just like shadow of 3D object on 2D plane.
        
    might be t is 5th Dimention like, (x,y,z,w,t)
